## 1. Compiler Configuration

TypeScript compiler configuration is given in <b>tsconfig.json</b> file, specifying how the Typescript file is transpiled to Javascript file.

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "declaration": true,
            "emitDecoratorMetadata": false,
            "experimentalDecorators": false,
            "module": "none",
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
            "noImplicitAny": false,
            "noImplicitReturns": false,
            "removeComments": false,
            "sourceMap": false,
            "strictNullChecks": false,
            "target": "es3"
        },
        "compileOnSave": true
    }

### 1.1 Tranpile and Execute Commands

To transpile TypeScript file:

    $ tsc fileToBeTranspiled.ts

To run JavaScript file in CLI:

    $ node fileToBeTranspiled.js

**_ [Demo 1] _**

## 2. Built-in Data Types

**_Donâ€™t ever use the types Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, or Object These types refer to non-primitive boxed objects that are almost never used appropriately in JavaScript code._**

src: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html

TypeScript supports five built-in data types.

    1. number
    2. void
    3. string
    4. null
    5. boolean
    [Any Type]

    // Use lowercase

### 2.1 Number

As in JavaScript, all the <b>numbers</b> are stored as <b>floating-point values</b>. Thus, regardless of Integer, Binary, Floating numbers are covered by <b>Number Type</b>. (See numberDemo.ts)

### 2.2 String

<b>String</b> can be used with <b>Expressions</b>, or i.e., expressions can be embedded intp the string value referencing to other string variables.

    e.g.,
    let appleStr: string = "apple";
    let embStr: string = `${appleStr} is a fruit`;

The syntax of expression is as follows:

    ${variableName}

<b>When using expression, neither single quote nor double quote should be used. Use `</b>

### 2.3 Boolean

Boolean has two values, either <b>"true"</b> or <b>"false"</b>.

### 2.4 Void

Void can be used as a datatype, tho it's not really useful. When it's treated as a datatype, it can only be assigned the value of <b>"undefined"</b> or <b>"null"</b>.

    e.g.,
    let nothing: void = null;
    nothing = undefined;

### 2.5 Null Type

Null represents a variable whose value is undefined. The Null accepts the only one value, which is null.

### 2.6 Any Type

Any Type is the super type of all data types. It is used to opt out of type checking in Typescript. I.e., it refers to "Any" data type.

## 3. User-Defined Data Type

User-defined data types include:

    e.g.,
    - Array
    - Tuple
    - Enum
    - Interface
    - Class

### 3.1 Array

There two ways to declare an array, one is by declaring the type of the element as in most of the language.

    var list: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Another way is to declare a generic Array type.

    var genericList: Array<number> = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];

### 3.2 Tuple

Tuple types allow expressing an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known. Types and orders matter.

    let tup: [string, number];
    tup = ["string", 123];

### 3.3 Interface

"In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project."

src: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html

An Interface can be considered as the minimum requirements of the values and their types (or their structure as a whole). Personally, it seems like this can be considered as an "object" that fulfills the required structure in terms of values (of same names) and structure (of same types).

This is called <b>"duck typing"</b> or <b>"structural subtyping"</b>.

For example, explicit structure can be declared without using interface:

    function displayName(personObject: { name: string }) {
        console.log("[Defined Structure] Displaying Name: " + personObject.name);
    }
    let obj = { age: 24, name: "curtis", do: "programming" };
    displayName(obj);

This can be improved with interface, which provides more functionalities and flexibility:

    interface PersonWithName {
        name: string;
    }

    function displayPersonName(personObject: PersonWithName) {
        console.log("[Interface] Displaying Name: " + personObject.name);
    }
    displayPersonName(obj);

The same object used in both methods will work in both methods, as it has meet the required structure declared in both functions. So, this is only a minimum requirement of structure.

An interface can have <b>optional properties with a ? mark</b> and the <b>read only</b> properties as follows:

    interface AdvancedPerson {
        // readonly, cannot be modified
        readonly name: string;

        // optional
        habit?: string;

        // optional
        age?: string;
    }

### 3.4 Class

Classes contains implementation inside, which are used as a template for creating objects like other languages. This is very similar to Java, excpet that it's optional to define the return type.

    class Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;

        constructor(name: string, age: number) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        getName(): string {
            return this.name;
        }

        // it's optional to claim the return type
        getAge() {
            return this.age;
        }
    }
    // use new keyword
    let me: Person = new Person("curtis", 24);

### 3.5 Function

Function can be <b>named</b> or <b>anonymous</b>.

    // named function
    function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
        return a + b;
    }
    console.log(sum(1, 1));

    // anonymous function:
    let mulytiply = function(a: number, b: number) {
        return a * b;
    };
    console.log(mulytiply(2, 5));

### 3.6 Enum

TypeScript supports <b>string-based</b> and <b>numeric-based</b> Enums. By default, elements' indices starts from 0. Though string and number can be mixed in Enum in TypeScript, it's just bad.

Without explicitly specifying string and number for the elements in Enum, their values are their <b>indicides</b>.

    // index-based enum
    enum Color {
        REG, // 0
        GREEN, // 1
        BLUE // 2
    }
    let myColor = Color.REG;

    // string-based Enum
    enum Class {
        GOOD = "A",
        INTERMEDIATE = "B",
        PASS = "C"
    }

    // number-based Enum
    enum Grade {
        GOOD = "70%",
        INTERMEDIATE = "60%",
        PASS = "50%"
    }

## 4. Generic

The way Generic works is quite similar to the one in Java, using "\<T>" notation for type checking.

    // T is a generic type
    function get<T>(stuff: T): T {
        return stuff;
    }
    let str: string = get<string>("A String");
    let num: number = get<number>(123456);

## 5. Decorators

Decorators are just like Annotation, which use <b>"@"</b> symbol. Tho, it is now experimental.

**_ [Demo 2] _**

## 6. Difference between Null and Undefined

**Null** is an assignment value, while **Undefined** is not an assignment value, it means that a variable is not yet assigned a value tho it's declared.

**Null** is an object, that is assigned to represent that such a variable is not pointing to any object nor having any value.

While performing primitive operations, **null** is coverted to **_0_**, and **undefined** is coverted to **_NaN_**.

## 7. TypeScript Variables

We can declare variables using keyword **var**. In ES6, we can define variables using **let** and **const** keyword, while they differ in scope and usage. In TypeScript, it is always recommended to define variables using let keyword, as it provides type safety.

    var [identifier]: [type] = value;

    let [identifier]: [type] = value;

Variables declared using **var** has a **Function Scope**.

Variables declared using **let** has a **Block Scope**, that they are scoped to the nearest enclosing block. Thus, it can be smaller than function scope. E.g., within if statement.

### 7.1 Re-declaration and Shadowing

With **var**, variables with same name can be re-declared many times, while we will only get one. This will not throw exceptions, and is actually valid, though it may cause bugs.

    For example:
        function do(a){
            var a;
            var a;

            if(...){
                var a;
            }
        }

With **let**, variables with same names cannot be declared.

**Shadowing** is the act of introducing a new variable with the same name in a more nested scope. One may take advantage of it and the different scopes, while it may cause confusion as well as bugs.

### 7.2 Hoisting (of Declaration)

In **hoisting**, variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their enclosing scope before code execution. Only declaration is hoisted not initialisations, however, this is for **var only, not let**.

    E.g.,

    // this is hoisted
    var hoistedVar;

    ........

    // this is not
    hoistedVar = 123456;

### 7.3 const Declaration

**const** keyword is for declaration of constant variables that cannot be changed later.

    e.g.,

    const APPLE = 1;

## 8. TypeScript Operators

**==** checks the values of two operands.

**===** checks both the type and the values.

**!=** not equal in terms of value.

**!==** not equal in terms of value and type.

### 8.1 Bitwise

**&** bitwise and

**|** bitwise or

**^** bitwise xor

**~** bitwise not

**>>** bitwise right shift

**<<** bitwise left shift

**>>>** bitwise right shift with zero appended

**expre ? true : false** same as in Java

### 8.2 Type Operators

**in** check whether one property is in the object

**delete** delete a specific property from object

**typeof** return type of operand

**instanceof** whether one is of a specific type

## 9. Type Assertion

Type assertion refers to the machanism that tells the compiler about the type of a variable. There are two ways of type assertion.

1. Angular Bracket<>

   e.g.,
   let name = <string> "curtis";

2. as keyword

   e.g.,
   let name = "curtis" as string;

**Type Assertion For Object:**

    e.g.,
    interface Buddy {
        name: string;
        age: number;
        habit: string;
    }

    let myBuddy = <Buddy>{};
    myBuddy.name = "MyBuddy";
    myBuddy.age = 24;
    myBuddy.habit = "Do nothing";

## 10. Array

- Index-based collection, starting from 0
- Homogenous, in that elements should have same data type
- Elements stored in continuous memory location
- Fixed Size

To declare array:

1.  Using square bracket syntax<br>
    let arr: **string[]** = ["we", "are", "string", "elements"];

2.  Using generic syntax<br>
    let arrTwo: **Array<string>** = ["we", "are", "string", "elements"];

To access elements by index:

    let firstElement: string = arr[0];
    let secondElement: string = arrTwo[1];

### 10.1 Multi-Dimensional Array

Syntax is simlar to Java

    let twoDimenArr: string[][] = [
        ["first", "row", "elements"],
        ["second", "row", "elements"]
    ];

To access elements in multi-dimensional array:

    // First element in second array
    let elem: string = twoDimenArr[1][0];

### 10.2 Array As An Object

Array is an Object, we can create an Array by calling its constructor, while there is no difference between this and above syntax.

    let sameArr: string[] = new Array("we", "are", "string", "elements");

### 10.3 Array Traversal

We can use **Traditional For loop**, which is the same as in java

    for (let i = 0; i < numArr.length; i++) {
        console.log(numArr[i]);
    }

We can also use **for in**, however it _"i"_ only represents the index, not the actual element.

    for (let i in numArr) {
        console.log(numArr[i]);
    }

### 10.4 Spread Operator in Array

**Spread Operator "..."** can be used to initialise arrays and objects from other array or object. It is called **Object De-structuring**, which essentially means taking the elements from an object and destructuring the original structure, so that you can take such list of elements to do something else, such as creating a new array.

    let array1: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2: number[] = [4, 5, 6];
    let mergedArr: number[] = [...array1, ...array2, 7, 8, 9];

### 10.5 Other methods of Array

src: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

#### 10.5.1 concat()

**concat()** to merge array

    let mergedArr: number[] = array1.concat(array2);

#### 10.5.2 copyWithin()

**copyWithin()** that copies one or more elements inside the array to other positions in the array. I.e., copy elements and overwrite elements starting from the targeted index. **This method changes the referenced array, so be careful.**

    let array3: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    console.log(array3.copyWithin(0, 6, 9));

The orginal array3 should be like:

     0                 6  7  8
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

We copy the elements starting from 6 to 9 (exclusive), and use these elements to overwrite elements start at 0:

     0                 6  7  8
    [7, 8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

So, "1, 2, 3" are overwritten by "7, 9, 0"

#### 10.5.3 every()

**every()** to test elements, it returns true if every elements satisfies the provided testing function, else false.

    function isNotZero(element: number, index: number, array: number[]) {
        return element > 0;
    }
    console.log(array3.every(isNotZero));

**every()** calls a **call back function** which takes exactly three elements, here _isNotZero_ is a callback function that examines whether all elements passed into are greater than 0.

#### 10.5.4 fill()

**fill()** to fill an array with a value from a speficied start to end index. Noted that it is really filling an array with values, instead it's **replacing elements with specified value**.

For example, code below doesn't produce an Array with five "\*" stars, even though it's specified to fill elements from 0 to 6. There are only four elements before fill().

    let array4: string[] = ["1", "1", "1", "1"];
    array4.fill("*", 0, 6);
    // output: [ '*', '*', '*', '*' ]

#### 10.5.5 indexOf()

**indexOf()** to return the index of the given elements. Return **-1** if not found. It is also **optional to specifiy from which index to start** searching the element.

    let array3: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    // look for 7, starting from index 2 (inclusive)
    console.log(array3.indexOf(7, 2));

#### 10.5.6 includes()

**includes()** to check whether the array contains such element.

    let array3: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    console.log(array3.includes(9));

#### 10.5.7 join()

**join()** to concatenate all elements as a string with the specified separator.

    let array3: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    // 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
    console.log(array3.join("-"));

#### 10.5.8 lastIndexOf()

**lastIndexOf()** find the last index of element in this array, return -1 if not found.

    let array3: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    console.log(array3.lastIndexOf(5));

#### 10.5.9 pop()

**pop()** to remove the last element in an Array. Last element is returned.

    let fruits: string[] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
    console.log("Poped: " + fruits.pop());

#### 10.5.10 push()

**push()** to push one or more elements to the end of an Array.

    fruits.push("Pineapple", "SomethingElse");
    // [ 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Pineapple', 'SomethingElse' ]

#### 10.5.11 reverse()

**reverse()** to reverse the order of elements.

    fruits.reverse();

#### 10.5.12 shift()

**shift()** to remove and return the first element (on the left hand side).

    console.log("Shifted: ", fruits.shift());
    console.log(fruits);

    // result:
    [ 'SomethingElse', 'Pineapple', 'Banana', 'Apple' ]
    Shifted: SomethingElse
    [ 'Pineapple', 'Banana', 'Apple' ]

#### 10.5.13 slice()

**slice()** to slice the array, which returns a "sub"-array based on the given start and end indicies. Ending index is exclusive.

    console.log(fruits.slice(0, 2));

#### 10.5.14 sort()

**sort()** that sorts the elements in the array.

    fruits.sort();

#### 10.5.15 splice()

**splice()** to insert or delete elements in an Array. It takes three types of parameters. **Array.splice(start, deleteCount(optional), items(optional))**.

**start: number** refers to the starting index, where to insert or delete. **deleteCount: number** how many elements after the starting index will be deleted, it can be zero and is optional. **items** are the elements that you want to insert, if deleteCount is greater than 0, it is kinda replacing certain number of elements, it is also optional.

    fruits.splice(0, 0, "BeforeApple"); // insert "BeforeApple" at 0
    fruits.splice(3, 1); // delete one element at 3
    fruits.splice(0, 1, "First"); // remove one element at 0, and insert "First" at 0

#### 10.5.16 toString()

**toString()** to return a string including the elements of an Array with a delimiter of ",".

    console.log(fruits.toString());

#### 10.5.17 unshift()

**unshift()** to append one or more elements at the beginning of an Array.

    fruits.unshift("Piggy", "Doggy");

## 11. Tuples

**Tuples** are of exact same meaning in SQL, which essentially means **a list of values where each element can be of different types and do not necessarily relate to eachother.** This is essentially an Array, where strong typing is applied when there are elements of different types.

Declare a tuple and define the type of each element:

    let row: [string, number];

(Must) initialise this variable:

    row = ["curtis", 123];

It is mutable, its elements can be changed after instantiation:

    row[0] = "banana";
    row[1] = 456;

We can also read its value with indicies:

    console.log(row[0], row[1]);

# 12. TypeScript Union

**Union** is a way to define a variable with multiple types of values (e.g., both string and number). It is declared using **|**. We can use **_typeof_** keyword to identify the type of the variable.

    let varName: number | string;

It can also be applied to collection like Array:

    let arr: number[] | string[];

Instead of using it for declaration, we can use union in function parameters:

    function display(arr: number[] | string[]) {
        for (let i in arr) {
            console.log(arr[i]);
        }
    }
