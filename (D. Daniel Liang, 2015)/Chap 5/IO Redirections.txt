Input Redirections and Output Redirections

Usually:
    the parameters of a program is entered in console, such as "Java program [curtis] [age] [name]"

Input Redirection:
    It can also be using a txt file to provide parameters, such as "Java program < [param.txt]", where the param.txt will provide the parameters using a dimiliter of space.

Output Redirection:
    Output redirection is slightly different in that it redirects the output to a file rather than showing them in the console, such as "Java program > [output.txt]".

Using both:
    "Java program < [param.txt] > [output.txt]"

Note: 
    In order to use input redirection, the System.in should be used, i.e., using Scanner.
