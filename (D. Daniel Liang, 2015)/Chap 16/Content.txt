        1.1 Labeled and Label
            Label is a small area for displaying text or images. Labels and Buttons share some common properties, which are included in class Labeled.
                - Label, A node
                - Labeled, a class that contains the common properties

        1.2 Button 
            A Button is a control that triggers the ActionEvent. Button includes: pure Button, ToggleButton, CheckBox buttons and RadioButton. The common features of these buttons are defined in classes Labeled and ButtonBase.

            Diff between Button and Label:
                A Button can be considered as a Label except that it has a onAction property that defines EventHandler.

        1.3 CheckBox
            It is similar to the Button, except that it contains a selection property to indicate whether it's checked.
        
        1.4 RadioButton
            RadioButton or aka option buttons, allows users to select one or more items from a group of choices. RadioButton is a subtype of ToggleButton.

                ToggleButton <-- RadioButton

            The major difference between the ToggleButton and the RadioButton is that RadioButton is rendered as a circle, while ToggleButton is rendered as a button.

            To group the RadioButton, a ToggleGroup is created, and the RadioButton will need to .setToggleGroup(ToggleGroup tg).
                
                /*
                    ToggleGroup group = new ToggleGroup();
                    rdOne.setToggleGroup(group); 
                    rdTwo.setToggleGroup(group);
                    rdThree.setToggleGroup(group);
                    rdFour.setToggleGroup(group);
                
                */
        1.5 TextField
            TextField is used either to display or enter a string. TextField is a subtype of TextInputControl

                TextInputControl <-- TextField

        1.6 TextArea
            TextArea is used for displaying multiple lines of text. TextArea is a subtype of TextInputControl

                TextInputControl <-- TextArea
        
        1.7 ComboBox
            ComboBox is also called as the choice list or dropdown list. ComboBox inherits from ComboBoxBase

                ComboBoxBase <-- ComboBox

        1.8 ListView
            A ListView is generally the same as the ComboBox, but it allows selecting multiple values.

                                                         >>> SINGLE
                - SelectionModel >>> SelectionMode >>> | 
                                                         >>> MULTIPLE

            The selectedItemProperty is a Observable object, which can be registed with a Listener to handling the change of the property. This property can be got from the SelectionModel

                - SelectionModel >>> selectedItemProperty() >>> .addListener(InvalidationListener il)
