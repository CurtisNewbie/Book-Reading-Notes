Chapter 11 Inheritance and Polymorphism:
    1. Inheritance
    2. super keyword and "Constructor Chaining"
        "When constructing an object of a subclass, the subclass constructor first invokes its superclass constructor before performing its own tasks." (p.417) This process repeats until the last constructor is called. 

        Because of this feature, a default constructor without any arg should be declear as a good practice, where the subclasses extend the constructor and avoid errors. 
    3. Overriding methods
    4. Overloading methods
    5. Polymorphism:
        "...a variable of a supertype can refer to a subtype object." (p.423) A thing can be considered as of different types or shapes depending on the context. 
    6. Dynamic Binding:
        This is the method invokation in the context of polymorphism and inheritance. The right method is called depending on which type the object is considered to be.
    7. Object casting and "instanceof"
    8. Objects "equals" method:
        Which is actually objectOne == objectTwo by default that compares ref. This is overriden in classes such as String, Date and etc.
    9. ArrayList
    10. Collections
    11. protected modifier
    12. final methods and classes prevent extending and overriding
