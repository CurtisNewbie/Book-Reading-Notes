# About Bookstore app

<b>bookstore-backend</b> is working perfectly fine, Restful api including simple GET, POST, DELETE requests can be used without problems.

<b>Swagger</b> is use to generate the documentation of the API, which is also expected to automatically generate TypeScript code for the Angular frontend, however, the generated code doesn't work without configuration. Experience and knowledge is lacking configuring the Angular frontend and the generated code, so this issue cannot be fixed.

<b>bookstore-frontend (Angular)</b> is now working except the code generated by Swagger Codegen. As the code generated by Codegen does not properly function, Json data are not extracted from the server. To run the app without error:

    Delete following folder:

    ./bookstore-front/src/app/services

<b>Swagger Codgen JSon Config File</b> can be generated by running:

    > mvn clean compile

The swagger.json file is generated at:

    > ./bookstore-backend/target/src/swagger.json

<b>SQL file</b> under ./bookstore-dbms/ are not used in this app. MySQL is not used in backend, instead, the backend/wildfly server uses its in-memory H2 DBMS.
