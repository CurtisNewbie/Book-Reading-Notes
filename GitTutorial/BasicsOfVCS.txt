Basics of Version Control System:
    
    There are two types of VCS:
        Centralised Version Control System (CVCS)
        Distributed/Decentralised Version Control System (DVCS)

    CVCS:
        CVCS uses a central server to store all files, while it may encounter the single point of failure.

    DVCS:
        With DVCS, clients can mirror the who repo. Git does not rely on a central server, so git is a type of DVCS, that all the changes are made locally and pushed to the remote repo.

    DVCS Terminologies:
        [Local Repository]: workplace or the local computer
        
        [Working Repository and Staging Area or Index]: working repo is the place where the files are checked out. When a file is commited, it is presented in the staging area. Git does not track all the files, instead it tracks on the files that present in the staging area.

        [Tree]: Tree is an object, which represents a directory. A tree is a binary file that stores references to blobs and trees which are also named as SHA1 hash of the tree object.

        [Commit]: Commits hold the current state of the repository. A commit is named by a SHA1 hash. 

        [Branch]: A line of development. By default, the major line of development is the master branch. A new branch is usually created to work on a new feature, once the feature is completeed, it is merged to the master.

        [Tag]: Tag is a naming a specific version in the repository. It is a immutable snapshot of the repo, which is usually created for product releases.

        [Clone]: Clone operation creates the instance/copy of the complete repo.

        [Pull]: Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repo to the local repo. It is synchronisation bewteen the remote repo and the local repo.

        [HEAD]: HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch.

    Basic Workflow:
        Local & Working Repo
                |  
                |              
                |     git add 
                |              
                |             
            Staging Area  
                |              
                |              
                |     git commit         
                |              
                |              
            Git repository
